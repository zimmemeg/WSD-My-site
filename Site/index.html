			The ZGMF-X19A Infinite Justice was developed by the Clyne Faction and was first deployed in C.E.74. It is very similar
			to its predecessor, the ZGMF-X09A Justice Gundam. Like the ZGMF-X20A Strike Freedom, the Infinite Justice is equipped with a 
			Nuclear Fission Reactor which allows it to fight longer and have more firepower than earlier models.
